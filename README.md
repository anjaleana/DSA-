Data Structure and Algoritms


Day1 :

 1. Need to understand space and time complexity
          
         a linear time : Big o(n)
         b.Contant time : Big o(1)
         c.Quadratic time : Big  o(n^2)
         
         ![big-o-notation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40524194/194045068-a9e68111-df8b-4cf9-94e4-26b56f40fd3d.jpg)

         
         How to say big oh o(n) or o(n^2).? There are two points
         
         1. Need to know fastest growing term
         2. Take out the coefficient.
