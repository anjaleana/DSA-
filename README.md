# DSA-
Data Structure and Algoritms


Day1 & Day2 :

 1. Need to understand space and time complexity
          
         a linear time : Big o(n)
         b.Contant time : Big o(1)
         c.Quadratic time : Big  o(n^2)

         ![big-o-notation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40524194/194046278-d7db20d5-fb42-41e4-b091-1b672a3917a3.jpg)

         How to say big oh o(n) or o(n^2).? There are two points
         
         1. Need to know fastest growing term
         2. Take out the coefficient.
Day3 to Day 10:

       Recursion and backtracking, one of the most importanct concepts(Need to strong)
       
Day 11 to Day 18:
       Arrays , linkedlist and Stacks and Queues
       
Can start contest, on hackerrank/leetcode/codestudio

Day 19 to 20 :
        Bubble sorting, insertion sorting, selection sort, merge sort , quick sort,
Day 21 to 28:
         Trees, hashtables, hashmaps, sliding window
Day 29 to 36 :
          Graphs, DP

Day 37 to 47:
       oops
Day 48 to 90 days:
       Continuing coding practice and learn new things
