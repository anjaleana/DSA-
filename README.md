Data Structure and Algoritms


Day1 :

 1. Need to understand space and time complexity
          
         a linear time : Big o(n)
         b.Contant time : Big o(1)
         c.Quadratic time : Big  o(n^2)

         
         How to say big oh o(n) or o(n^2).? There are two points
         
         1. Need to know fastest growing term
         2. Take out the coefficient.
